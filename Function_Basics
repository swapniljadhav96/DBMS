//The syntax of creating a stored function in MySQL is as follows://

DELIMITER $$  
   
CREATE FUNCTION fun_name(fun_parameter(s))  
RETURNS datatype  
[NOT] {Characteristics}  
fun_body;  


//Now, we will create a function that returns the customer occupation based on the age using the below statement.//

DELIMITER $$  
CREATE FUNCTION Customer_Occupation(  
    age int  
)   
RETURNS VARCHAR(20)  
DETERMINISTIC  
BEGIN  
    DECLARE customer_occupation VARCHAR(20);  
    IF age > 35 THEN  
        SET customer_occupation = 'Scientist';  
    ELSEIF (age <= 35 AND   
            age >= 30) THEN  
        SET customer_occupation = 'Engineer';  
    ELSEIF age < 30 THEN  
        SET customer_occupation = 'Actor';  
    END IF;  
    -- return the customer occupation  
    RETURN (customer_occupation);  
END$$  
DELIMITER;  


//We can also see all stored functions available in the current database using the following statement://

SHOW FUNCTION STATUS WHERE db = 'mysqltestdb';  


//Stored Function Call//
Now, we are going to see how stored function is called with the SQL statement. The following statement uses customer_occupation stored function to get the result:

SELECT name, age, Customer_Occupation(age)  
FROM customer ORDER BY age;  


//Stored Function Call in Procedure//
Here, we are going to see how this function can be called in a stored procedure. This statement creates a procedure in a database that uses Customer_Occupation() stored function.

DELIMITER $$  
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerDetail()  
BEGIN  
    SELECT name, age, Customer_Occupation(age) FROM customer ORDER BY age;  
END$$  
DELIMITER ;  
The below statement can be used to call the stored procedure:

CALL GetCustomerDetail();
